- Changed window title & icons
- Added BOLT (Gas that creates lightnings and fusionates to HYGN on heat. Very unstable! Freezes to VIBR at around absolute zero.)
- Modded FIRE to be decorable
- Added FLSH (Flash Powder. Explodes with a flame coloured like itself, and small pressure.)
- Added PLDM (Palladium. Can absorb HYGN, converts it into CO2, NBLE and OXYG if sparked.)
- Added OTWR (One time wire. Since every mod seems to have one.)
- Changed the graphics of SPRK to be less glowy
- Added PLST / LPLS (Plastic. Made from OIL, deforms under high pressure, melts at moderate temperatures. Slightly flammable.)
- Modded OIL to polymerize into PLST on pressure
- Added BASE (Base. Acts like ACID, but neutralises it to SALT.)
- modded ACID to neutralize it to SALT and ignore SALT / added it to the create_part thing.
- Added SOIL (Soil. SEED can gow to PLNT on this. Mix with WATR to produce MUD.)
- and MUD (Mud. Can be heated into BRCK.)
- and SEED (Drop it on SOIL and watch it grow!)
- changed PLNT and VINE a bit to integrate with it
- Added ANT / ANT2 (Langton's Ant. Turing machine. Basically LIFE, but better.)
- Changed WIFI to break at higher pressure
- Changed CO2 to have a chance to create BOLT or LIGH once it fusionates
