look at the forum post and the git history for more informations.

- Changed window title & icons
- Added BOLT (Gas that creates lightnings and fusionates to HYGN on heat. Very unstable! Freezes to VIBR at around absolute zero.)
- Modded FIRE to be decorable
- Added FLSH (Flash Powder. Explodes with a flame coloured like itself, and small pressure.)
- Added PLDM (Palladium. Can absorb HYGN, converts it into CO2, NBLE and OXYG if sparked.)
- Added OTWR (One time wire. Since every mod seems to have one.)
- Changed the graphics of SPRK to be less glowy
- Added PLST / LPLS (Plastic. Made from OIL, deforms under high pressure, melts at moderate temperatures. Slightly flammable.)
- Modded OIL to polymerize into PLST on pressure
- Added BASE (Base. Acts like ACID, but neutralises it to SALT.)
- modded ACID to neutralize it to SALT and ignore SALT / added it to the create_part thing.
- Added SOIL (Soil. SEED can gow to PLNT on this. Mix with WATR to produce MUD.)
- and MUD (Mud. Can be heated into BRCK.)
- and SEED (Drop it on SOIL and watch it grow!)
- changed PLNT and VINE a bit to integrate with it
- Added ANT / ANT2 (Langton's Ant. Turing machine. Basically LIFE, but better.)
- Changed WIFI to break at higher pressure
- Changed CO2 to have a chance to create BOLT or LIGH once it fusionates
- Added Magnesium (MGSM and MGMP)
- Added ENZM (Enzyme, breaks down things into OIL, grows with GOO, cures VIRS like SOAP does.)
- Added LITH (Lithium, rusts in empty space, explosive, produces ELEC when in contact to BIZR. Recharges when sparked with GOLD.)
- Added RADN (Radon, emits NEUT, decays into DEUT and HYGN. Fusionates to BOLT around 6500 C.)
- Added SSTN (Sandstone. Erodes easily with ACID or BASE.)
- Merged mniip's new (awesome) console from github.com/mniip/The-Powder-Toy/branches/console
- Added reaction PROT+NEUT=RADN
- Made DYST spread out slower
- Changed energy particles to be smudge-able
- Added BULB (Light bulb. Decorator, glows when constantly sparked.)
- Added RVRS (Reversium, reverses changes to elements. Explodes extremely powerful on contact with TRON/BOLT! Also the heaviest liquid.)
- Added GRVT (Graviton, emits a gravitional field equal to its tmp; after its life period bursts with a field equal to its tmp2.)
